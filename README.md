<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I selected this theme in honour of the individual after whom my institute was recently renamed, 
 inorder to shed light on his contributions to the world of Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence. </p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>My web is divided into 9 sections</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hero Section</li>  
  <li>Contents</li>
  <li>Biography (subsection Contents)</li>
  <li>The Bombe (subsection Contents</li>

<h3>Hero Section</h3>
<img src="" alt="Hero Section Image Alan Turing" style="width:50%">
<p>I used a background image created via artificial intelligence in Dall-e which blended all the colours in my colour palette. I used a special Call to<br>
 Action button "Enigma" associated with Alan Turing with special electric effects which are iniatiated upon hovering. The Call to Action button <br>
 leads directly to the Contents Card Menu of the Web. The semi-transparent navegation bar is located along the superior part of the Hero Section in PCs, 
 but tranforms into a Hamburger Menu, located in the superior right-hand corner, in tablets and mobile phones.
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Contents</h3>

<p>The section is divided into a blockquote section in the upper portion of the section and in the bottom portion a grid layout of 3 cards which alter from a 33%/33%/33% layout
in PCs down to a 100% one-column layout in mobile phones to achieve responsiveness in different screen sizes. The cards, which contain theme-related images, act as a Contents
Menu which when clicked on lead directly to one of the three subsections: The Biography, The Bombe & Other Inventions.</p>
<p></p>


<h3>Subsections (3):</h3>

<h3>(1)The Biography</h3>
<p>This subsection contains a basic two grid layout with a black and white portrait of Alan Turing and introduction paragraph of his biography. There also a Read More button styled
 with the special "Computer Style Lettering" used in all buttons. Upon clicking, the Read More button links directly to the Britannia Enciclopedia Web Page on Alan Turing´s Biography.</p>

<h3>(2)The Bombe</h3>
<p> This subsection contains a grid layout containing a video created by Mr Sensible Historic: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTNgeNFuCDM&t=1501s">(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTNgeNFuCDM&t=1501s)</a> & its the corrsponding link to YouTube and in addition, related text. The Read More button links 
 to an article written by the National Museum of Computing reviewing the book released on the same topic "The Bombe: The Machine that defeated Enigma" by the author Dermot Turing.</p>

<h3>(3)Other Inventions</h3>
<p>This section contans an accordion with a specially designed pattern background (created via an online pattern generator <a href="https://doodad.dev/pattern-generator/">https://doodad.dev/pattern-generator/</a>
 blending the colours used in the Project´s Colour Palette. The two-section accordion upon click opens up to brief information on the Turing Test and the Turing Machine and each one 
contains a Read More button linking to articles relating to each of these inventions:

<h3>Fun Facts Section</h3>
<p>This section contains a responsive grid layout (two columns in PC and down to 1 in mobile screens). The grid is composed of a video titled "Three Crazy Facts" by the Homo Deus Project with
corresponding link to Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6yma88eQhs"> </a>) and an image containing a portrait of Alan Turing and the Apple logo. Upon clicking, the image links to an article written by Manchester´s Finest titled "Myths of
Manchester: The Apple Logo & Alan Turing."<a href="https://www.manchestersfinest.com/articles/manchester-myths-apple-logo-alan-turing/">https://www.manchestersfinest.com/articles/manchester-myths-apple-logo-alan-turing/  
</a></p>

<h3>Footer</h3>
<p>My footer contains my Social Media links, Credits links, and a copy of my navegation menu. In Pc in also includes an image relating to 
 Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<h2 id="pagestyle">Estilo de la página</h2>
